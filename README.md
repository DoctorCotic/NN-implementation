Neural Networks
===========================
```Necessary for work:```
1) Theano or TensorFlow computational backend library
2) Library of deep learning of the neural network Keras
3) NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

```Repositories```
1. conv - Convolutional neural network by example cifar10
2. istm -
3. mnist - NN by mnist data
4. vgg16 - NN recognizes images on pre-trained networks (16 layers)
