Neural Networks

===========================
Necessary for work:
1) Theano or TensorFlow computational backend library
2) Library of deep learning of the neural network Keras
3) NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

===========================
conv - Convolutional neural network by example cifar10
istm -
mnist - NN by mnist data
vgg16 - NN recognizes images on pre-trained networks (16 layers)
